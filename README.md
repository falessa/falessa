### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ¤– I'm a Software Engineer, with over 10 years of experience as a QA Engineer and SDET.

ðŸ“– I deeply enjoy learning new things every day. A few years ago I started digging into Frontend engineering, especially working with React, Javascript/Typescript, 

This is a professional and personal space to experiment, share and learn everyday âœ¨

Some of the projects I developed in my spare time are listed below. If you'd like to ask for a feature, report an issue or contribute, please get in touch ðŸ™‚
