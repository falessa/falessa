### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ¤– I'm a Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience as a QA Engineer and SDET. I'm currently exploring the Frontend Engineering field.

ðŸ“– Iâ€™m passionate about learning and exploring new technologies. In recent years, Iâ€™ve been focused on frontend development, particularly working with React, React Native, and JavaScript/TypeScript.

ðŸ¤“ This GitHub space is both professional and personal - a place to experiment, stay up-to-date with the latest tech, and build creative solutions.

Below are some projects Iâ€™ve developed in my spare time. If you'd like to request a feature, report an issue, or contribute, please [get in touch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/flaviagramajo/). Iâ€™m always happy to hear from the community!
